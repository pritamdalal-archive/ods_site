Option Data Science was founded by Pritam Dalal, with a vision of helping guide the options industry into the data revolution.

Prior to launching ODS, Pritam held a variety of trading and analysis roles at firms such as Cargill, Wolverine Trading, Allianz Investment Management, and Two Harbors Investment Corp. A common thread running through all of his work has been data-driven analysis, coupled with the ability to communicate those findings to fellow decision makers. These skills have been applied to areas ranging from volatility trading in commodity markets, to equity option market-making, and hedging complex annuities.

In addition to serving clients, Pritam is an adjunct professor in the mathematics department where he [teaches](https://pritamdalal.github.io/fm5990_site/) graduate students about the rich intersection between data science and quantitative finance.

Pritam holds a Bachelors in Mathematics and Economics from U.C. Berkeley, and a Masters in Financial Mathematics from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.
